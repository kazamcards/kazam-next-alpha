# Kazam Cards

Issues:

1.  Problem: Upon Isaac joining the group, we realised that he could not be added to the Jira without Katya's approval. At the time, she was on leave from the project and could not be quickly contacted.
    Status: Resolved. Katya approved the join request via mobile when notified.
2.  Problem: We're too neurodivergent for this and keep getting distracted.
    Status: Unresolved.

Bugs:

1.  Problem: Footer appears twice.
    Cause: Footer was in both the layout.tsx but also manually included on the homepage.
    Status: Resolved.

2.  Problem: Deployments failing.
    Cause: Errors in TypeScript - params in the indivdual product page was being flagged for its type not being declared.
    Status: Testing.
